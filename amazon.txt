Answer below:
1) Can you reach a high accuracy on the test set using random forests?
    No, you can't reach a high accuracy using random forests it's mostly due to the fact that their
    are way to many splits. 

2) Can you think of a better way to choose split functions (as opposed to the method in _find_split)
    Randomly selecting features seems to be problem here, because not all of them are important in order to 
    make proper predictions. What we can do, is assign weights to the features that are more significant. which
    would  result in more accuracy.

3) How does this challenge differ from that with the occupancy dataset?
    In the previous dataset we had 2 classes here we have 50, which would require a lot of trees, to be 
    able to make the prediction right.
