Answer below:

1) Is a single DT prone to over-fitting with the occupancy dataset?
    Yes a single tree is more prone to overfitting as all of the training
    data gets mapped to one tree. 

2) How does classification accuracy behave as a function of the number of trees?
   If you have multiple trees it will definetly avoid  over-fitting. Since we will 
   have multiple variations of it. 

3) Do you think the random forest was helpful?
    Ofcourse since it provides variation in features and data. By using less trees in our 
    forest we can easily represent most variations in the data to accurately predict.
